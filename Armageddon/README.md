### Planes , UFOs, and Earthquakes - Visualizing Armageddon Part 1

This was probably my favorite project that we did in this class, although it did
give me the biggest headache. I followed the instructions from this [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/introduction-to-interactive-geoplots-with-plotly-and-mapbox-9249889358eb) to make the visualization.
Learning to use plotly and mapbox was definitely a cool experience. I plotted
earthquakes in orange, ufo's in blue, and airports in green as outlined in the
assignment.
